This repository is a collaborative documentation area for the Nubis project. The
projects main purpose is to provide tooling and systems that enable cloud
deployments to be fast, simple and secure.

Feel free to look around. We appreciate any feedback or pull requests you feel
would add to this effort.

## Getting started with the Nubis Project

Welcome to the Nubis Project. We hope you will find that it meets your
requirements and is easy to use. In this document I will introduce you to the
Nubis Project and give you a number of links to other documents that will help
you along.

The Nubis Project is in essence a collection of services that simplify the
process of deploying applications to the cloud. We take care of the little
things so you can focus on what matters, your application. We treat security as
a first class citizen, so you can rest assured that your application will be
safe in the cloud. At this time we support only Amazon Web Services (AWS). For
an overview of our design principles I recommend you read our [manifesto](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/MANIFESTO.md).

### Familiarize yourself with the Nubis Project

Now, to get you up to speed with everything you will need to know to use the
Nubis Project, I will provide for you a reading list. Not to worry, while this
list looks long most of the documents are quite short.

* [Nubis Overview (NOTYET?)](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)
  Will give you an outline of the pieces of the project.
* [Git & GitHub](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/GIT_GITHUB.md)
  provides some advice specific to Nubis.
* [Templating](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/TEMPLATING.md)
  walks through some recomendations on structure and workflow.
* [Project Onboarding](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/PROJECT_ONBOARDING.md)
  will guide you through on-boarding your first application.

### Deployment

Now that you are familiar with the project and the process it is time to get
coding. The first step is to assemble your deployment repository. Then it will
be time to deploy into the sandbox.

As we have seen in various examples through these documents, you will need to
create a deployment repository. Take a look at the [System Overview(NOTYET?)](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)
document for details.

Once your repository is all set up the next step it to deploy into the sandbox.
You can deploy by following the procedures outlined in the [Project Onboarding](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/PROJECT_ONBOARDING.md#application-build-out)
doc. Some example commands can be found in our trusty [nubis-mediawiki](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-mediawiki/blob/master/nubis/cloudformation/README.md)
repository.

### Bugs, Contributions and more

We are super excited to have you here. If you have stumbled into an issue there
are several ways to address it.

First, you can fix the issue yourself and file a pull request. You will find a
guild in our [Contributing Doc](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Next, you can file an issue. Simply navigate to the Nubis Project organization
on Github [here](https://github.com/Nubisproject), select the appropriate
repository and click on the issues link. For example to file an issue against
nubis-stacks you would go [here](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-stacks/issues)

Finally if you are looking for a new feature to be supported, simply follow the
[Feature Requests](https://github.com/Nubisproject/nubis-docs/blob/master/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md)
guide.
